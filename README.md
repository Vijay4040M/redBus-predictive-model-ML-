**About Hackathon**: 
Title: **"redBus Data Decode - Data Science Hackathon 2025"**
Duration: 14 June 2025 - 22 June 2025

In the bus transportation industry, demand forecasting is more than just a pricing tool- it shapes marketing campaigns, discount strategies, SEO initiatives, and much more. The challenge? Less than 20% of bus bookings are made well in advance, leaving limited early signals to accurately predict demand. This makes forecasting highly complex and demands innovative, data-driven solutions.

This hackathon aims to forecast the number of travellers for a specific journey date, with a prediction window of 15 days in advance.
